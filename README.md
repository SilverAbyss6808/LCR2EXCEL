# LCR2EXCEL v0.2
## Add your Labor Cost Report to your cost-tracking spreadsheet quickly and easily!

### To install:
1. Download the source code ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/SilverAbyss6808/LCR2EXCEL/tags). Make sure you download the most recent version (right now, that's v0.1.0).
2. Extract the ZIP file somewhere on your computer - it doesn't matter where.
3. Run the LCR2EXCEL.exe file. It'll be located in the LCR2EXCEL\dist\main folder. Alternatively, use the shortcut provided in the LCR2EXCEL folder.

**Important note: don't move the exe file out of the folder it's in - if you want it to be in an easier-to-access spot, create a shortcut, then put that shortcut wherever you want.**

2. Enter the file path to the Labor Cost Report - make sure it's a .pdf file.
3. When asked for the path to an Excel sheet, just hit the Enter key. A default name will be given - you can change this if you want. NOTE: If you're specifying your own name, make sure you include the full path, e.g. **C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\NewExcelSheet.xlsx**
4. Let the program run!
5. The new spreadsheet, if a directory is not specified in Step 3, will be generated in LCR2EXCEL\dist\.

## FAQ
- The program is starting up/extracting very slowly.
  - That's normal - it's not frozen, just loading. A loading screen will be added in the future to reduce confusion.
